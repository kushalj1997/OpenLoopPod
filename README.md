# OpenLoopPod
The Code that will go on the Pod's processor

The Processor for the Pod has not been determined.

Possible quick-to-implement options include:
	Raspberry Pi (some variant)
	Arduino (some variant)
	STM32 Processor (some variant)

An Intel Core i5 would be phenomenal to use, however I have no knowledge on how to program it.
An embedded systems approach would be best.
